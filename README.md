# DéggWolof Flashcards App

A simple web-based flashcard tool for practicing Wolof ↔ English vocabulary.

## How to use

1. Open the site https://philshams.github.io/DeggWolof/
2. Click **Download flashcards** if you are a first-time user or **Import flashcards** if you already saved your progress.
3. Click a card to flip it.
4. Mark **Got it** or **Missed it**.
5. Before closing out your study sesh, use **Export** to download your updated vocabulary with progress saved to your computer.

## How it works

* Cards are shown in both directions (Wolof → English and English → Wolof).
* Each direction is tracked separately.
* A card is considered mastered only when both directions are correct.
